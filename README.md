# raspi-projects

Source code for various projects I've done on my free time for the Raspberry Pi

## Requirements

I used a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B for these projects.  Other versions should work, but pin assignments may need to be editted in the source code.  All projects were run on the default Raspian OS.
Aside from that, follow the wiring instructions indicated in the initial comments of each project's source code.
